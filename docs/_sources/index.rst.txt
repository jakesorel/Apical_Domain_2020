Induction of de novo mouse embryo polarization
==============================================

This webpage provides the documentation for the code used to perform simulations in the Zhu et al. paper *Induction of de novo mouse embryo polarization*. Details of the mathematical methods and motivation behind the model formulation are found in the Supplementary Modeling document attached to the main paper. 

For detailed overview of how to use the code, please see our `Google Colab notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Zad4oDGEN_C9DH9xC3Obl5yyHEKwrGv4?usp=sharing>`_.
